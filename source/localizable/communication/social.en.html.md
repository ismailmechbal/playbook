Being a company working with technology, it makes sense to use for being present in the digital media and context.

Last years we have been growing the social network base and the content type we share to make presence in different ways and markets. The main objectives of the communication strategy through social networks is to generate qualified leads but also attract talent that want to join the team as part of our [Continuous Recruitment](/content/hiring) strategy.

Nowadays, some tools like [Zappier](http://zappier.com), [Buffer](http://buffer.com) or others, help us to automatize flows in particular social networks, and help us to be more accurate once we are moving things around the Internet.

The next list considers the most used social networks in Icalia Labs and the reasons why we keep them:
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/icalialabs): We publish all type messages
