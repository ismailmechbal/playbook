      We have a strategy of continuous recruitment, which means sniffing and attracting the best talent we can, always. We may have no particular task for people joining, but what we have is a clear set of responsibilities that they need to start developing.
      </p>
      <p>
      Usually, before looking for a particular role, we:

      <ul>
        <li>make a list of skill attributes as well as desired personal/cultural attributes - accountability,</li>
        <li>share the position on our website, social media, job boards in Universities and Word of Mouth,</li>
        <li>screen all resumes / github profiles for technical & cultural fit.</li>
      </ul>

      A typical job description defined in our organization is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9zgY3p4P7yOTna-kyyJcq2eU1b0b-mbD3TvylJa19M/edit">Software Engineer</a>. Once a company is growing, is hard to clearly establish all skill attributes and responsabilities for every role, that's why we take as a reference for inspiration the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0xBLypwwoZAc2NuM2pxbTBTVzA/view?usp=sharing">Job Description Compendium</a>.

      A talk about what you are doing right now, your passions and the future. This is a very casual encounter, and happens just when we have developed confidence in previous sessions such as meetups, hackathons or the candidate is just part of the social network from somebody in the team.

      There's always the possibility of stopping the procedure and notifying the candidate with transparency about the details is very important and a sign of kindness. People not matching in terms of culture - step 0 and 1, is a red flag; those attitudes and personal values are things that might be very difficult to change, so adapting to our culture would be highly difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
      People stopping in the next steps, we use to give them 3 months in case they don't advance, and if they try again and happens the same situation, we give them a year to apply again. This is mainly because we need to give some time to candidates to breath, take time, analyze the process and live a different experience with other team members and challenges, but also to not abuse the opportunities and time from our team.
