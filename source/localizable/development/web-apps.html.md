We use [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) to build most of our web
applications. Using Rails helps us get a stable MVP to our clients
quickly. Check out our [CTO's](http://github.com/kurenn) book about
building [APIs with Rails](http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/)!

We also made a number of tools to help speed up the development process
including:

* [Furatto](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/furatto) to build elegant HTML views.
* [Toll](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/toll) to handle simple API authentication.
* [Pager API](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/pager-api) to paginate API records.
* [Acts as User](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/acts_as_user) to handle multiple
user roles.
