      The stereotypical designer and developer don't get along because the developer
      arrogantly thinks the logical view is the only correct way to view the world,
      while the designer is idealistic and free-thinking. At Icalia, we look for
      people that are a little more balanced and good communicators; this means that
      communication between the development and design teams isn't such a chore, in
      spite of our different backgrounds.

      <strong>Some concrete things that have helped us are:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      - Sit down with a developer, one-on-one, to really understand how they work and
      the basic syntax of the development language. This is a big time commitment, but
      it pays off in the long run to have designers that understand how the
      application works.
      </p>

      <p>
      - Monthly tactical meetings with representatives from both the design and
      development teams (5 people total). In these meetings we decide what specific
      tasks each teams can undertake to improve the overall development and design
      process. This could be learning a new skill, finding better prototyping tools,
      or finding better ways to work together.
