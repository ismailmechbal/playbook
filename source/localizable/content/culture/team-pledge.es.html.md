* “Clients” aren't clients, they are our partners and we work long­-term.
* There are no such thing as users, they are people like us.
* Usability and experience design are processes, not deliverables.
* Pick a few things to do well; don't try to do everything.
* Always show a working product; it is the main measure of progress.
* Don’t copycat ideas, but look at current solutions and figure out how to
improve and execute them.
* Always ask why.
