We welcome interns as part of our commitment to help grow the local tech
community.

Our summer interns, both developers & designers, are assigned a mentor for the
duration of their initiation on the internship. Throughout the internship they are
given guidance as they work on a project.

Many interns have transitioned to become long-term interns, or apprentices,
and have successfully taken on client work and become fully integrated with the
team while still in school.

Interns often don't have much real-world experience, so we work with them
starting with the very basics. We look for curiosity, enthusiasm, and
some related training (usually graphic design, computer science, or engineering
majors).
