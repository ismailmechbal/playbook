The team pledge is a combination of service and internal team commitments that help us move forward in a Kind and Integer way.

The service need from us the next principles:

* "Clients" aren't clients, they are our partners and we work with them long­-term.
* There are no such thing as users, they are people like us.
* Usability and experience design are processes, not deliverables.
* Pick a few things to do well; don't try to do everything.
* Always show a working product; it is the main measure of progress.
* Don’t copycat ideas, but look at current solutions and figure out how to
improve and execute them.
* Always ask why.

The internal team pledge can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0xBLypwwoZAX3E2UXZHZW9YdzQ2dVptSjQ0SmpWRGN0Ym1F/view?usp=sharing), and help to establish order and rules to any exception or anomaly while we coexist.
