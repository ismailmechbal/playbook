We have a great, bright office in historic downtown Monterrey. Besides the
usual tech perks like coffee, snacks and an open office plan, we have a
fantastic view and within walking distance of eateries, bars, museums, and
parks.

Why a decent workspace is worth it? Why co-location matters?

1. **We can develop our passions, not only a daily work.**
Our workspace has a great view, source of inspiration for any creative individual. The office is located literally on downtown, so we have found a lot of food places, coffee shops, restaurants, bars to hang around after a busy day, even places with live music for Thursday or Friday night, complementing our workskapce. This definitely give us freedom. Freedom to administrate our time, our activities and our creative sources to build the type of products we build.

2. **Demands commitment and responsibility from the entire team.**
This last quarter we established new objectives to start generating, in our possibilities, only american leads. Our actual clients from US require from ourselves to push forward our capabilities, improve our processes and change for the better the things we have been doing on the last years with little or local clients. They really don’t care about the place we are located, what they really care is about the quality and deadlines on a product; even we use a decent amount of tools to keep constant communication this place should demand from us more responsibility in everything we do to sustain a smooth operation.

3. **We needed a worthy place to receive anyone: clients, providers, community.**
Last offices were a little bit of a problem to have special sessions with clients, to have a call with a client, or to arrange a big meetup. We were looking for a place already distributed to handle this type of situations. We wanted a place where all people related to this company feel comfortable and don’t have any problem to really add the value needed with our services. We wanted a place to feel free to create, share and learn.

4. **If a huge and admirable tech company were looking to move into Mexico, what kind of place will they choose?**
We need to benchmark with the big players. Kuri and me wanted to build something admirable in terms of workspace 4 or 5 years ago, when the first conversations happened about starting a company. We need to start building it now. We see pictures everyday of built to last tech companies, and the real fact is workspace really matters. If we weren't able to choose for this space, it would take more time to push growth within the company.

5. **We are now working on the interior design of our space**, analysing all possibilities and ready to invest on enhancing the experience of being working on the iconic place we want.

We really want to explore more ways of working. We are an anxious generation of explore new experiences, and as the company evolves, the world is going to be doing the same. Although, we started as a co-located culture and that decision as part of our strategy has been really helpful.
