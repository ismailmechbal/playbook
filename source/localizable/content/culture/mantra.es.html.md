<h1 class="article-title">Team Pledge</h1>

“Clients” aren't clients, they are our partners and we work long­term.

There are no such thing as users, they are people like us.

Usability and experience design are processes, not deliverables.

Pick a few things to do well; don't try to do everything.

Always show a working product; it is the main measure of progress.

Don’t copycat ideas, but look at current solutions and figure out how to
improve and execute them.

Always ask why.

<h1 class="article-title">Client Pledge</h1>
Always be in touch with the development team.
We are human beings, we work from 9am to 6pm (we also eat)
