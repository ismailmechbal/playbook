Speaking up is definitely something desirable in any workplace. Great workplace cultures and great companies -in addition to wanting employees to speak up with ideas, doubts or even complains- encourage a safe and comfortable environment for employees to share those ideas or thoughts.

That's where recognition happens, being open and realising every comment and action needs to be applausable.
