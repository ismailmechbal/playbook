In Icalia Labs it is needed to involve technical profiles during the initial assessment for any type of product. Technical Managers can assess time, risk, resources & operation of the projects. They as well can measure the alignment of the lead objectives with Icalia’s objectives and determine if that lead can be converted to a client and work for the long-term.

The Technical Managers involvement need to happen during a negotiation, so there are different steps where managers enter:

1. Communicating to managers
The involvement of managers should be well communicated via email, explaining the lead profile, needs and with the assumptions worksheet already filled. A meeting between the sales person and the manager could be needed to explain all general details to let them assess the lead profile at its best.

2. Resources Analysis:
All manager should understand a coming project and see if availability from our side is possible in the expected date for the beginning of the project. The tool we use to see the availability from every member is via https://teamgantt.com, all manager with this responsibility should have access to the entire Gantt of the Icalia’s operation.

3. Qualification of clients
	This part needs to be assessed in terms of the technical and creative challenges the team visualize in the product. If this project is going to survive, and the client’s ambitions are big, same as our team, we can start working with that client. Also some commons sense elements can be involved, such as the initial values discussed during a sale; the most important can be trust in our team.

4. Estimates
For an accurate estimate, there should be a scheduled Spike Session among the possible team involved. Designers, Mobile Developers, Back-end Developers, Managers, anyone who may be involved needs to assess the project in terms of time and corroborate the possible time to invest in the project. Also, if efforts can be separated in sprints, that would provide an accurate measurement of efforts.

5. Last adjustments on estimate
	If some adjustments need to happen because of clients clarification or the team realized that some elements need to change, then the original estimate should change. This needs to be communicated to the actual lead. 

These steps are part of the lead conversion path, and they need the involvement of managers to go forward along the selection procedure.
