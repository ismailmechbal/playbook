Our target market is funded startups and enterprise businesses.




There are certain rules every client should have, so we donâ€™t work with:

1. Bootstraped startups; those not investing full-time, doesn't have money investment and are not looking to rise or a serious Business Model. (yodiunmoche, Gidit, etc.)
2. Non-profits without a technical person in the organization. (MX100)
3. ~~Mexican~~ Government; delayed payments and very bureaucratic.
4. People without a product owner; there needs to be somebody committed to follow-up the project during the week in planning sessions.
5. Projects without considering function or a back-end. Doesn't mean we are not able to only design, but we don't work static or informative pages.
6. Clients that are going to be in the middle between us and the final client. (Bakery Interactive)
