Most of our leads come from referrals from former and current clients and
coworkers.

2.1 Lead Management

	First of all, it is important to define what a Lead is. A sales lead (potential client) is the identification of a person or entity that has the interest and authority to purchase a product or service. This step represents the first stage of our sales process. The identification of the sales lead is referred to as lead generation.

There are two ways to generate leads:
They contact us, or
We contact them.

1) They Contact Us

	They come to the team through different sources -- email, website, face-to-face talk during a meetup, etc. The lead recognizes the existence of the company and the main factor is Word of Mouth (WoM). Our clients, community, partners and the Icalier team are the main source to share information from ourselves to potential leads. From 2012 to 2014, 100% of our clients contacted us first. WoM is the best marketing strategy we have.

2) We contact Them

	TBD - A new procedure to be discovered in 2015.



What if we have a saturated workload and no people are available for new clients?

	We have a simple rule: Once the majority of the team is involved in different projects, the only way to start hiring and recruiting to start with new clients is having at least 1 project of a 12-months contract or 2 projects of at least 6-months contract.  

	There is a term called bench, meaning the number of people without assigned a project or specific task. Our bench rate is 20% of the employees. It is not bad nor good to have a 20% -- it helps to be ready when new clients want to work with us, but having a full team working help us to surpass financial expectations.






2.2 Lead Classification

	We manage leads with Boomerang for Gmail tracking the conversations with reminders, following-up with Streak and via Trello. We classify them in the next categories:

Minor Lead:
Someone interested in our services but we haven’t figured out if it totally fits with our value proposition.
Probably a company looking for certain services and doesn’t fit our entire procedure.
Small company without enough budget to pay for our services.
Potential Lead:
They can cover the man-hour rates of the company.
They have analysed what they might need.
Closing Deal:
Previous to sign a contract.
About to define starting date.
Seeking approval of budget and needs.
Customer (Converted Lead)
Someone who already sign the contract and has a project started with us.
Non-Customer (Non-converted Lead):
A lead who didn’t fit with our proposal as a company.
Reasons can be: not enough budget, bad timing, needed android development.


2.3 Finding & Generating Leads (TBD):
How we find prospects varies. Some have heavily-trafficked websites. Some are in tight user-groups that refer work to one another. Others find their leads online, but all successful consultancies find a way to get their foot in the door with new clients regularly.

For my own business's sake, I became serious about finding prospects regularly. I built a daily system for collecting their emails and phone numbers. I used twitter, job boards, industry websites, anything that could help me find more prospects.


In order to manage the Leads, these are great tools for lead generation:
Social Networks: Twitter, Linkedin, Crunchbase, AngelList, etc.
Incubators & Accelerators.
Meetups and networking events.
Strategical Intros to CEOs, VPs, Managers, etc. in companies.
Competition.

_Important Facts when selling and converting a lead into a client:_

* Long-term projects have a best customer lifecycle value, more revenue, more established situation and a defined team. At least 6-12 months.
* Little projects are to cover death times. These aren’t our main focus.
* Payment schema: We recommend to equally divide the estimated price between the months along the project. Monthly retainer à la Printoo. First payment as an advance and last payment when finished the project.  
* If the lead need from us to sign an NDA, it can be signed but it should be very explanatory to evade conflicts with previous projects. Also, signing an NDA can lead to a situation where the customer doesn’t develop enough confidence in the relationship.
* The sales cycle have varied between projects. The fastest sales has been done between 7 and 15 natural days (vRide, MoneyPool & Printoo).
* The longest sale have taken 2 months or more. We should not wait more than 2 months to close a new customer.
* Lesson: Always ask “why” in a polite way when people reject your sales pitch.
* Going Leads is more about following-up http://blog.close.io/switch-software
* We don’t take started projects from the past, they can give us more problems because new bugs can emerge, bad documentation exists, and so on.
* Management of Sales Force Proposal:
  1. Prospecting / initial contact
  2. Preapproach - planning the sale
  3. Identifying and cross questioning
  4. Need assessment
  5. Presentation
  6. Meeting objections
  7. Gaining commitment
  8. Follow-up
