Once the potential client gets in touch with us, we discuss with them
whether Icalia is the right fit for their project. Since we focus on web and
mobile applications, we usually don't take on simple landing pages, websites,
or social media management.



Part of the sustainability of the company is to work for our clients, loyal organizations who believe in the quality of the work we do at Icalia Labs. They are so important not only for that reason, but for the reason they are part of the elements that can help us to achieve our vision in the right time.

	Choosing the right leads, negotiations, stakeholders, products and ambitions can lead both parties to great outcomes, so we need to previously asses every client very good before closing any kind of deal.

	There are different steps for a relationship between a client and Icalia to be followed:
Attention
Patience
Security and self-confidence.
Trust.


The recipe is to always be closing. Always be closing new sales, new projects, new ambitions. For some inspiration look at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-AXTx4PcKI
