The stereotypical designer and developer don't get along because the developer
arrogantly thinks the logical view is the only correct way to view the world,
while the designer is idealistic and free-thinking. At Icalia, we look for
people that are a little more balanced and good communicators; this means that
communication between the development and design teams isn't such a chore, in
spite of our different backgrounds.

Some concrete things that have helped us are:

* Sit down with a developer, one-on-one, to really understand how they work and
the basic syntax of the development language. This is a big time commitment, but
it pays off in the long run to have designers that understand how the
application works.

* Monthly tactical meetings with representatives from both the design and
development teams (5 people total). In these meetings we decide what specific
tasks each teams can undertake to improve the overall development and design
process. This could be learning a new skill, finding better prototyping tools,
or finding better ways to work together.
