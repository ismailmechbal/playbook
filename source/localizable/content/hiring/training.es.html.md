One of the main tasks and focus to keep our culture and practices solid is a unique training. We have learned from many situations, and we are aware the importance of training in a company, no matter dimensions, workload or industry. As a startup, training is what will reduce learning curves, accelerate productivity and generate immediate engagement on new members.
