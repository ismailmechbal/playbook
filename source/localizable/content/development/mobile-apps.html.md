Most of our mobile apps are iOS. We have built a couple of tools to help
handle images in iOS apps including:

* [ILParabolicImageView](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/ILParabolicImageView)
that adds motion effects to an ImageView as the iPhone moves.
* [UIImage-ImageCompress](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/UIImage-ImageCompress)
that compresses images to optimize uploads.
