We made a couple of in-house tools to help developers get up and running
quickly:

* [Kaishi](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/kaishi): set
up dev tools and other fun stuff &
* [Platter](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/platter): an easy Rails project
builder with our preferred gems ([RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec), [FactoryGirl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl), [versionist](https://github.com/bploetz/versionist), and more).
