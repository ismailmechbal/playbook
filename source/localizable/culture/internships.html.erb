      We welcome interns as part of our commitment to help grow the local tech
      community.
      </p>

      <p>Our Interns, both developers & designers, live the Internship experience while they have assigned a mentor for the duration of their initiation on this process. Throughout the internship they are
      given guidance as they work on a project.</p>

      <p>Many interns have transitioned to become long-term interns, or apprentices,
and have successfully taken on client work and become fully integrated with the
team while still in school.</p>

      <p>Interns often don't have much real-world experience, so we work with them
starting with the very basics. We look for curiosity, enthusiasm, and
some related training (usually graphic design, computer science, or engineering
majors).</p>
