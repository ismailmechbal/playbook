During the life of a project, needs and specifications can change. To keep
development on track, we have weekly update meetings (along with a written update
via email or Basecamp post). On a monthly basis, we like to take a step back and
look at all the open tickets on Pivotal. By grouping them into themes, we can
help the client prioritize their requests and make expected results more tangible.
