Our [Guides](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/icalia_guides) go into the specifics
of best practices, in general we stand by:
+ Build on what's already out there (don't reinvent the wheel).
+ Pick convention over configuration.
+ Keep the next developer in mind (make sure your code is clean, simple, and
  follows a style guide).
+ Be kind in giving and getting feedback from teammates.
