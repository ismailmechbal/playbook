We can deploy to many different types of server infrastructure & platforms,
such as [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/),
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/).
Also our expertise with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) allows us to deploy
Docker hosts and "dockerized" apps into our client's existing private
infrastructure.
