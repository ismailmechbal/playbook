Here at Icalia, we believe that culture is something that defines a team. It is
not necessarily bad or good, but it is what defines us. It is a set of values
and a pattern of basic assumptions and beliefs, learned behaviors, and norms
that define us.

Here at Icalia our Vision is "Being in 10% of the world's technology by 2025."

Our Mission is "Provide the best service and team to develop and design usable, useful and
functional technology products for anyone in the world."

Culture is something that defines a team, starting with the vision and mission.
It is not either bad or good, is what defines us, is a set of values manifesting
through behaviour and ritual, it is a pattern of basic assumptions and beliefs,
learned behaviors, shared values and norms that define ourselves.
