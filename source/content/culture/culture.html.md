Here at Icalia, we believe that culture is something that defines a team. It is
not necessarily bad or good, but it is what defines us. It is a set of values
and a pattern of basic assumptions and beliefs, learned behaviors, and norms
that define us.

Here at Icalia our Vision is "Being in 10% of the world's technology by 2025."

Our Mission is "Provide the best service and team to develop and design usable, useful and
functional technology products for anyone in the world."
