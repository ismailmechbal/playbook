Here at Icalia, we believe that culture is something that defines a team. It is
not either bad or good, but it is what defines us. It is a set of values
and a pattern of basic assumptions and beliefs, learned behaviors, and norms
that define us.

Here at Icalia our Vision is "Being in 10% of the world's technology by 2025."

Our Mission is "Provide the best service and team to develop and design usable, useful and
functional technology products for anyone in the world.""

<h1 class="article-title">Team Pledge</h1>
- “Clients” aren't clients, they are our partners and we work long­term.
- There are no such thing as users, they are people like us.
- Usability and experience design are processes, not deliverables.
- Pick a few things to do well; don't try to do everything.
- Always show a working product; it is the main measure of progress.
- Don’t copycat ideas, but look at current solutions and figure out how to
improve and execute them.
- Always ask why.

<h1 class="article-title">Client Pledge</h1>
- Always be in touch with the development team.
- We are human beings, we work from 9am to 6pm (we also eat)
