We welcome interns as part of our commitment to help grow the local tech
community.

Our summer interns, both developers & designers, are assigned a mentor for the
duration of their 8 - 12 week internship. Throughout the internship they are
given guidance as they work on a project.

Many interns have transitioned to become longer-term interns, or apprentices,
and have successfully taken on client work and become fully integrated with the
team while still in school.

Interns often don't have much real-world experience, so we work with them
starting with the very basics. We look for curiosity, enthusiasm, and
some related training (usually graphic design, computer science, or engineering
majors). The recruitment section has more details about the interview process.
