At Icalia Labs we care about our team member’s capabilities and imaginations.
Work shouldn’t be drudgery. As part of our existence and the daily activities,
it is important to keep imagining and creating internal products in order to
not because complacent.

Every single member at Icalia Labs has 20% of their workweek to get involved in
extraordinary things. We have learned that Friday is the best day to spend
this non-billable time. While it’s important to allow for 20% creative time,
we must have achieve the 80% **effective** time dedicated to clients'
projects first. Icaliers need to complete their
weekly client goals in order to enjoy the 20% creative time. If we haven’t
finished weekly work, we should dedicate the rest of the time to finishing any
pending tasks; we care about our clients--after all, they are the reason why we
are here and can enjoy creative time.
