When starting a new project, we like to follow a process that we call the "Icalier Way".
This 7-step process helps build a strong relationship with the client and helps
ensure that we produce a [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
that meets client expectations in a timely fashion.

### Step 0 - Kickoff meeting
Goal:

Time: 2 hours

Activities:

* Meet the whole team (including developers, designers, product managers).
* Discuss client and Icalia pledges.
* Designate a product owner.
* Set up access to tools (Basecamp, Pivotal Tracker, Github).

<br>
### Step 1 - Understanding
Goal: Have a clear starting point for the whole team. Clarify the problem,
customer, business, users, and value proposition.<br>
Time: 1 - 3 days<br>
Activities:

* Fill out an Assumptions Worksheet.
* Assumptions with sticky notes. Group them in topics à la Design Thinking.
* Prioritization (Assumptions) Matrix.
* Define the Business Opportunity.
* Define the Problem.
* Define the Value Proposition (why will people pay you?).
* Define context­specific terms (this will act as a dictionary).
* Define the Customer with a Persona Profile.
* Discuss short term and long term business goals (What’s the driving vision?).
* Fill out the Business Model Canvas (this should be continually revisited).
* Gather and analyze existing research.
* Gather inspirational and informative examples of other people/products solving similar problems.
* Storytelling of people using the product.
* Planning: Define possible needs/next modules (eg. User Research, Functional or not functional MVP)

<br>
### Step 2 - Definition
Goal: Define the potential solution to be built in order to attack the problem
or opportunity. Explore as many ways of solving the problems as possible,
regardless of how realistic, feasible, or viable they may or may not be. This
module helps to build a shared understanding across stakeholders and the tech
team. The team should be prepared to constantly ask, “How might we...”. in a
collaborative design format and should be prepared to generate, develop, and
communicate new ideas.<br>
Time: 1 - 2 days<br>
Activities:

1. Introduction: Agenda, Pledges & Core Team [5-­10 minutes]
2. Problem exposure and constraints (presentation or group discussion) [20 minutes]
3. Definition of persona profile [15 minutes]
4. Graphic Identity Session [45 minutes]
5. Solution Prioritization [90 minutes]
  a. Hypothesis creation table: Hypothesis and sub­hypotheses
  b. Goals and Objectives
  c. KPI Prioritization (Outcomes) with *candy*
  d. Feature Brainstorming
  e. Define MVP (features & acceptance cases)
6. Design Studio ­­ take parts of the problem or the most important user story
  a. Individual idea generation (diverge ­­ white paper in 6 boxes) [10 minutes]
  b. Presentation and critique [3 minutes per person].­ 5 whys reference
  c. Iterate and refine (emerge) [5­10 minutes]
  d. Team idea generation on whiteboards [45 minutes]
  e. Storyboard the core customer flow. This could be a work flow or the story (from the
  customer’s perspective) of how they engage with, learn about and become motivated to
  purchase or utilize a product or service [45 minutes]
7. Start planning user recruitment (based on Proto Persona definition)

<br>
### Step 3 - Design & Prototyping
Goal: The goal is to have a non­functional prototype as fast as possible to see
interaction and move forward into coding.<br>
Time: 1 - 10 days<br>
Activities:

1. Define Design Architecture (screens, use cases)

2. UI Flow ­Storyboard
  * User Interface
  * User Experience
  * Interaction proposals

3. Design Review

4. Branding
  * Brandbook (logo, colours)
  * Styleguide Definition

5. Sketches (Wireframes)

6. Design Review
  - Mockups
  - Design Review
  - Assets:
    a. Logos
    b. Icons
    c. Animations
    d. CSS
  - Prototype generation (Non­functional or Semi­functional).

<br>
### Step 4 - User Research
Goal: Validate, understand, and prove/disprove assumptions early in the
product-building process. The main goal is to learn sooner, saving time and
effort in development and design and reducing risks.<br>

Time: 1 workday, plus 8 - 12 hours for user testing<br>

Activities:

* Quick n’ Dirty Research (Discovery & Usability)
  - Recruit selectively: Key number is 5
  - 1 user that doesn't fit the profile
  - Create Screener: Survey with non-specific or guided questions
  - Define distribution channels.
* Session with users
* Review and Impressions Session
  - What needs to change?
  - Return to Module 2 if we have our assumptions were way off, or
  - Return to Module 3 if a few tweaks are needed

<br>
### Step 5 - Build
Goal: Write the actual code<br>

Time: Project-dependent<br>

Activities:

<br>
### Step 6 - Measure, Learn, & Groom
Goal:
<br>
Time:<br>

Activities:
